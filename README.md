# Tables
## Basic Table Structure
* < table >: The < table > element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. 

* < tr >: You indicate the start of each row using the opening < tr > tag. (The tr stands for table row.) 

* < td >: Each cell of a table is represented using a  td > element. (The td stands for table data.)
